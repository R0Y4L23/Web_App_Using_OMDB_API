# Web_App_Using_OMDB_API<br>
Tried creating a Web App using an API<br>
This website contains a search bar using which information of any movie can be searched<br>
Provided the movie exists on OMDB server<br>
NOTE : The design of Website is NOT pretty and responsive and so it is not uploaded on GitHub Pages.<br>
The main purpose of this project was to learn how AJAX requests from an API works.<br>
If you want to see how this website works , clone this project and run it yourself ;-)
